Makes Google snappy and removes all the distractions so you can concentrate on search results. No ads, no side pictures, no annoying javascript, just clean uncluttered search results ! If you remember how good it was when google was only doing search, well this is pretty close. It also gives direct links to websites, so they open faster and google can't track your clicks.

[ Google Images ] 
Brings back the classic Google Images interface !
The standard interface is nice the first 5 minutes, but if you've had to use it for longer periods you know how tiring it can be. Classic interface gives space to breathe and also adds an easy on the eye black background mode.

[ Features ]
- Blocks javascript on google search and images.
 This gives access to the lighter, non js version.
- Removes ads (aka 'sponsored results')
- Makes look and feel customizable
- Brings back classic google images interface
- Adds a 'Night Mode' to google images.

Other google extensions generally don't support the non js version of Google, so it can also:
- autoload next results
- display favicons

Also saves bandwith, with web search for example:
- first time: 137k instead of 422k.
- afterwards: 19k instead of 101k.

[ Opera Search Engine Setup ]
Use these two to avoid the redirection with the default search settings, they'll take you straight to the right place.

- Better search results !
By default google uses fuzzy search, which gives poor search results in many cases. Use google's 'Verbatim' mode so it searches for exactly what you typed. To have opera use it by default: 
> Tools->Preferences->Search->Google, Edit, Details, set Address to this and click OK:
> http://www.google.com/search?q=%s&hl=en&tbo=1&gbv=1&prmd=ivns&source=lnt&tbs=li:1&sa=X

- Google Images
While you're at it also add the one for Google Images:
> Add, Name: Google Images, Keyword: i, Address:
> http://images.google.com/search?q=%s&hl=en&gbv=1&site=imghp&tbm=isch&num=20&sa=N

Now you can just type 'i calvin hobbes' in the address bar to find your favorite comics.

[ Link Tracking ]
Google won't be able to track your clicks on Google Search and Images. This is useless however if Google Analytics can track you on all the sites you visit. Install Ghostery !
