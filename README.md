Google Classic
==============

Clean, Light and Fast Google Search !

Get the extension from Opera [addons](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/google-classic).

Makes Google snappy and removes all the distractions so you can concentrate on search results.
No ads, no side pictures, no annoying javascript, just clean uncluttered search results !
If you remember how good it was when google was only doing search, well this is pretty close.
It also gives direct links to websites, so they open faster and google can't track your clicks.

Also brings the classic Google Images interface back !
The standard image wall interface is nice the first 5 minutes, but if you've had to stare at it
for longer periods you know how tiring it can be. Classic interface gives space to breathe and
also adds an easy-on-the-eye black background mode.

Features
--------

- Blocks javascript on google search and images.

  This gives access to the lighter, non js version.
- Removes ads (aka 'sponsored results')
- Makes look and feel customizable
- Brings back classic google images interface
- Adds a 'Night Mode' to google images.

Other google extensions generally don't support the non js version of Google, so it can also:
- autoload next results
- display favicons

Also saves bandwith, with web search for example:
- first time: 137k instead of 422k.
- afterwards: 19k instead of 101k.

Link tracking
-------------

Google won't be able to track your clicks on Google Search and Images. This is useless however if Google Analytics can track you on all the sites you visit. Install [Ghostery](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ghostery/?display=en) !
